# Exposure Unit Library

## Description

This library provides classes and functions used in the **Arduino PCB Exposure Unit Controller** project.  
It contains definitions and implementations of necessary classes to manage **OLED display output, timers, and user input via a rotary encoder with push button**.

The library is designed to be included in Arduino sketches and works with the ATmega328P-based PCB of the exposure unit.

## Files

- `.h` header files with class and function declarations  
- `.cpp` source files with class and function implementations  

## Installation

  Copy the library folder into your Arduino `libraries` directory.
